# Data analysis for *Genomic modulators of gene expression in human neutrophils* ![DOI][doi img]
This repository contains code for some of the analyses carried out as part of the work that has been published as

Vivek Naranbhai *et al.* **Genomic modulators of gene expression in human neutrophils**.  
Nature Communications 6, Article number: 7545 (2015). [doi:10.1038/ncomms8545](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150707/ncomms8545/abs/ncomms8545.html) 

## Overlap between eQTL and epigenetic data from neutrophils
The *blueprint* directory contains details of the analysis focused on overlap between eQTL identified in neutrophils 
and DNA methylation data as well as histone modifications obtained from the
[Blueprint consortium](http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/).

## Validating allele specific binding through ddPCR
A STAT3 binding site identified during the ChIP-seq analysis as showing evidence of allele specific binding 
was selected for validation. Details of the analysis of ddPCR data generated for this purpose are available
in the *ddPCR* directory.
